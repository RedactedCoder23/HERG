# HERG — Hypervector Emergent Reasoning Graph

Experimental engine that fuses
* deterministic hypervector encodings,
* persistent “capsule” nodes,
* a sparse capsule-to-capsule graph, and
* a lightweight GNN message pass

…to enable continual, branching reasoning on commodity GPUs.

See `DOCS/capsule_graph.md` for the design spec.
